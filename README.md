# Calvin's Projects
Here are a few of the projects I've been working on

# [Project 1: CDC COVID-19 U.S. Case Surveillance](https://github.com/Calvindsza/CDC-COVID-Cases-US)
* Gathered 10M records from the CDC public data set
* Created a time series starting from January 2020
* Also made frequency plots by gender, ethnicity and age group

# [Project 2: Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Global Time Series](https://github.com/Calvindsza/JH-COVID-Global-TS)
* Gather time series data from JHU GitHub to create a time series
* Took 3 different time series data sets (deaths, confirmed and recovered) and merged into one dataframe
* Converted Wide to Long format to be able to use in time series
